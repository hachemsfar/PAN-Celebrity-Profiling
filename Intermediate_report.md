# Intermediate Report 

### What we have done
- [X] We have asked for the access to the university server to be able to laod the  15 Go datset into memory. 
- [X]  We have lighten the database and keep only one tweet per follower, we plan to increase the number of tweets per follower in the final training. 
- [X] We have completed all of the pretreatment steps that we mentioned in our report.
- [X] We have built our BERT model and retrain it to predict the age, occupation and gender of the celibrity.

### In progress 
- [ ] We are doing the Neural Network model to predict the age, occupation and gender of the celibrity.

### What we plan to do in the next step

- [ ] We plan to use logistic regression model to predict the age, occupation and gender of the celibrity.

### Questions
 - How can we use tf-idf (frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) to get the the n most frequent bigrams of m randomly selected tweets per celebrity follower.
